QILVGallery is a javascript application to view images linked from a webpage.

The application can be launched on any page contaning links to images, using a simple bookmarklet

Right now, it only works in :
  * Firefox (probably in all gecko based platforms).
  * Google Chrome (probably in all webkit platforms).
